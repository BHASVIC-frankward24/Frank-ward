# Frank-ward		
## Professional Goals:		
### - Get through college and into a university to study software engineering.				
### - Get a job in programming or working ina  data base.		
## What I'm working on:
### - I'm currently in the middle of a two week long work experience project at Orcale, my previous week (7th - 11th July) looking at data centres and spending each day working with the employees there, and this next week (14th - 18th July) Looking at the various job possitions in their offices.		
### - In college I have just started a new project in which you choose your own product to design, and spend time researching similar products and what consumers/stakeholders of it would want to see within it. For which I have chosen to make a rogue-lite, wave based survival game.		
## What I have done:
### - As preciously mentioned I have done a weeks work experience in some of Oracles data centres, during which I had helped replace various cables, replaced a motherboard & two CPUs, as well as helping to install 5 new server racks. 		
### - I have also done a GCSE in computer science, for which I had gotten a grade 6 in.		
## Relevant soft skills:		
### - In college and in my work experience I have worked with numerous groups, helping to develop my communication & teamwork skills.		
### - I have a tendancy to be quite persistant, helping me stick to a project despite any difficulties or errors that may occur as it progresses.

## Precious work:    
### https://github.com/BHASVIC-CompSci/animalopoly-BHASVIC-frankward24    
### - This is the 'Animalopoly' Work I had done in my contribution to the overall project. For which I had done the Player and Board class. Doing this I had better developped my teamworking & understanding of the importance in good communication skills amongst a group.    
### - This project also severly helped my understanding of arrays in Java, due to the extent I was using them in the board class and to store each player.    
### https://github.com/BHASVIC-CompSci/recursion-BHASVIC-frankward24    
### - This task, although simple, had taught me about recursion, and its uses. A feature which I consider plenty, each time I make a loop, it had also helped me see functions as more than a way of organising work when coding in C.
