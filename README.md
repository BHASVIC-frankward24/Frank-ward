### - In college I have just started a new project in which you choose your own product to design, and spend time researching similar products and what consumers/stakeholders of it would want to see within it. For which I have chosen to make a rogue-lite, wave based survival game.

## Relevant soft skills:		
### - In college and in my work experience I have worked with numerous groups, helping to develop my communication & teamwork skills.
